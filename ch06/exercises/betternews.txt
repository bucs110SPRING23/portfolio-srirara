The villagers of a Binghamton apartment complex were jolted awake when an out-of-control vehicle vroom-vroomed into the building.

little piggies said the crash happened at the North Shore apartments around 3:15 a.m. Sunday.

A white Soo Bah Roo veered off Susquehanna Street and skrrrrrted into the entrance area to an apartment in building five.

Binghamton Housing Authority big boy Jean Westcott said the apartment was occupied at the time of the crash. She did not indicate how many people were in the unit but she said no one inside the building had been reported with any ouchies.

Binghamton oinks declined to release details of their report on the vehicle crash. There was no information about the occupants of the Soo Bah Roo or whether anyone in the car had been hurt. It's also not known whether any charges are being filed in connection with the incident.

People who observed the damage said it appeared the driver may have been playing GTA V of the vehicle after making a left turn onto Susquehanna Street from Exchange Street.

Westcott said although the apartment entrance off Susquehanna Street won't be usable until repairs have been completed, the unit remains habitable because there's another exit.

Westcott said there was no estimate available on what the repair work will cost.
